# About Me  

I am a senior Software Engineering student at Drexel University, graduating in June 2025. Through co-ops at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Susquehanna International Group, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience building APIs, optimizing data pipelines, and developing web applications.  

I am passionate about problem-solving and look forward to employing these skills in whatever challenges the future brings. Currently, I am seeking full-time software engineering opportunities starting in the summer of 2025.
